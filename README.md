# C course by ITMO University, 2nd year studying #

The course is studied within the framework of the subject "Programming languages". In this course, 
me should complete the online course "C Programming and Program Execution" on the Stepik platform (link: https://stepik.org/course/73618/), 
as well as perform two laboratory work on the following topics:

1. Image rotation
1. Memory allocator. 

Both labs are uploaded. Read local README file for more information. 

This repository represents my progress in this course. Course solution & both lab works are checked by a teacher. My mark for this course is A. That's why I hope these solutions can help you to do your tasks too. Good luck!
