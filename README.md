# C course by ITMO University, 2nd year studying #

The course is studied within the framework of the subject "Programming languages". In this course, 
me should complete the online course "C Programming and Program Execution" on the Stepik platform (link: https://stepik.org/course/73618/), 
as well as perform two laboratory work on the following topics:

1. Image rotation
1. Memory allocator. 

Both labs are uploaded. Read local README file for more information. 

This repository represents my progress in this course. Will be updated in the case of a teacher's verdict that edits are needed. I hope this doesn't happen :)
